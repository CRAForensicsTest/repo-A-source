# Repository A - Source Code

This repository contains dummy code for a GitHub migration test.

**Files:**
- `index.html`: The main page for our test website.
- `styles.css`: CSS for basic styling.
- `script.js`: A simple JavaScript file.

The goal is to migrate all contents of this repository to a new, empty repository while preserving the entire Git history.
